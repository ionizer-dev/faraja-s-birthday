            Dear Faraja 😂 <br><br>
            On this special day, I just want to tell you how amazing, kind, and truly wonderful you are. Even though we haven’t known each other for long, I feel really lucky to have met you. Your energy, humor, and positivity make every moment fun, and I’m genuinely glad our paths crossed. I hope today is filled with laughter, happiness, and love, and that the year ahead brings you all the joy and amazing memories you deserve. Happy Birthday, Faraja! ❤️<br><br>
